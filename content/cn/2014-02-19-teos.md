## 名词所有格

一般加's，以下为例外

  - the heel of Achilles
  - the laws of Moses
  - the temple of Isis
- Jesus’
- for conscience’ sake
- for righteousness’ sake
- hers, its, theirs, yours与oneself无所有格

## 列举三个或更多名词除最后一个外用逗号分割

- 商店名最后一个逗号用and替代

## 插入语用逗号分割

- 只要使用，必须成双配对

- 两个用连词连接句子中间的插入语前面的逗号要放到连词之前

## 在and或but之前用逗号来引导子句

- 避免使用so，会导致滥用，不如改用as提到前面去
      As I had never been in the place before, I had difficulty in finding my way about.
- 如果句子很短，可考虑用逗号
      The gate swung apart, the bridge fell, the portcullis was drawn up.

## 不要把一体的句子用句号打断

## 分词的主语要确定

## 句尾断词要按照词的组成或发音来切割
