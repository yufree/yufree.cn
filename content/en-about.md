Hi, My name is YU Miao and I am currently a scientist at the Jackson Laboratory.

My major is Environmental Science and I have to learn lots of knowledge to investigate a specific environmental question. In this case, I have to be a dabbler in many science topics. I also like cooking, photography, programming, solving puzzles, reading,... However, I am good at none of them. In this cas, I am a dabbler in life, too.

I am lazy, so I just modified [Yihui's pages](http://yihui.name) to show this blog(in fact, I just got the parts which I could figure out the meanings and thanks a lot, Yihui). But I am always willing to learn something new and this blog will be focused on something interesting in my life.

Since English is not my mother tongue, you have to bear my tongue to read my articles.

Don't panic!
