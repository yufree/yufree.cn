This is the first paper written by me which was just published on *Environmental Science & Technology*, pp 13494–13501, Volume 47, Issue 23, 2013. You could access the full text either by [ACS's website](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es404144p) or just send [Dr. Liu](mailto:liujy@rcees.ac.cn) or [me](mailto:yufreecas@gmail.com) an email. 

This work focused on the metabolites of BDE-28 in plant. The main finding is that after the exposure, BDE-28 could be transformed to OH-diBDEs, OH-triBDEs and MeO-triBDEs. Without the standards of metabolites, the MeO-triBDEs were identified as para-MeO-triBDE by thumb rules. This is interesting because we found all of the literature about the MeO- metabolites of PBDEs are para-MeO-PBDEs. Though *Science* has published a [paper](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/307/5711/917.short) in 2005 which show some Ortho- MeO-PBDEs has a nature source, our finding reveal that the metabolites of PBDEs may also have some features to show their sources. However, there are little works reporting the MeO-PBDEs as metabolites, so more proof is needed.
