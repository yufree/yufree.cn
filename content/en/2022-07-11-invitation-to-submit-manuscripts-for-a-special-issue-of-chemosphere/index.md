*Special issue information*

Current environmental chemistry and toxicology studies mainly focus on a single stressor or single group of stressors, which does not reflect the multiple stressors in the dynamic exposome that humans are facing. Usually, human exposures are presented as cocktails with thousands of organic chemicals and dozens of inorganic chemicals being presented. However, the significant relationships and interactions among those stressors in the environment and their holistic human health effects remain unclear. Fortunately, the rapid developments of various techniques provide us with the possibility of revealing these mixture exposures. This Chemosphere special issue aims to provide a platform to dissect the complexity of chemical mixture exposures from experimental, analytical, and computational perspectives.
