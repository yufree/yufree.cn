Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are transformative fields of computer science. They empower researchers to develop algorithms and models capable of extracting meaningful insights, making predictions, and automating tasks by analyzing and learning from data. Due to the intricate nature of environmental health issues, the integration of AI and machine learning is imperative. These advanced computational technologies have the potential to revolutionize environmental health studies through fundamentally improve and advance environmental exposure assessment, environmental health risk assessment, and environmental policy development.

This Virtual Special Issue from [Environment & Health](https://pubs.acs.org/journal/ehnea2) extends an invitation to scientists to share their innovative work on leveraging AI and ML for environmental health studies.

We welcome contributions of Articles, Reviews, Perspectives or Viewpoints that delve into topics including, but not limited to:

Source appointment
Chemical toxicity prediction
Identification or screening of unknown pollutants
Human exposure assessment
Molecular mechanisms between exposure and disease
Data compliance and ethics
By sharing these findings or perspectives, we hope to spur further innovation and advancements in this critical and rapidly evolving field.
